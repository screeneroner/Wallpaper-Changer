# Wallpaper-Changer

This script **automatically changes your desktop wallpaper** 
at a **specified interval** using free random images 
**from an online source** (https://picsum.photos/). 
The script uses the primary monitor's resolution 
as the default wallpaper size that may be changed later. 

**Features implemented in right click tray menu items**:
1. Force Reload: Immediately change the wallpaper to a new random image.
2. Save Current Image: Save the current wallpaper to a file with a timestamp.
3. Set Image Size: Customize the wallpaper size by entering desired dimensions as WIDTHxHEIGHT.
4. Set Interval: Set the time interval (in minutes, can be fractional like 0.5) for changing wallpapers.
5. Buy Me a Coffee: Opens a link where you can support the developer.

**Usage**:
- Right-click the tray icon to access the menu options.
- Double-click the tray icon to force a wallpaper change immediately.
- Saved images are stored in the script directory with the current date and time as the filename.
